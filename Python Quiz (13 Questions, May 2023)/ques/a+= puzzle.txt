A += assignment puzzler
Try to answer without using the console: what is the result of evaluating these two
expressions6?
Example 2-14. A riddle.
>>> t = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> t[2] += [50, 60]
What happens next? Choose the best answer:
a) t becomes (1, 2, [30, 40, 50, 60]).
b) TypeError is raised with the message 'tuple' object does not support item
assignment.
c) Neither.
d) Both a and b.
When I saw this I was pretty sure the answer was b but it’s actually d, “Both a and b.”!
Here is the actual output from a Python 3.4 console (actually the result is the same in a
Python 2.7 console):
Example 2-15. The unexpected result: item t2 is changed and an exception is raised7.
>>> t = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> t[2] += [50, 60]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> t
(1, 2, [30, 40, 50, 60])
